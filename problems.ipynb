    "### Padding \n",
    "\n",
    "Before a message can be processed by the SHA-256 algorithm, it must be **padded** so that its total length is a multiple of **512 bits (64 bytes)**.  This is to prepare the data before pushing it to the hashing algorithm.\n",

    " \n",
    "**Padding** process as defined in the [Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4, § 5.1.1, 5.2.1)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) works as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the message of length (L) bits.  \n",
    "2. Add a single `1` bit (`0x80` in hex, that marks the end of the original data.  \n",
    "3. Add enough `0` bits so that the total length ≡ 448 (mod 512).  \n",
    "   – This leaves 64 bits (8 bytes) at the end to note the message length.  \n",
    "4. Add the **64-bit big-endian** representation of L (the original bit length).  \n",
    "   – “Big-endian” means the most significant byte is written first. \n",
    "5. The result is one or more **512-bit blocks**, ready for hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps guarantee every padded message is exactly 512-bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simply Said\n",
    "Padding makes sure every message fits perfectly into 512-bit blocks so SHA-256 can process it correctly.\n",
    "It labels itself with the original message, adds a single **“1”** to mark its done, fills the space with **buffer zeros**, and finishes by writing down its **length** at the end!\n",

    "     These are just temporary variables used during the mixing.\n",

    "   - Each round uses the W words, constants K[t], and the functions Σ₀ (Sigma0), Σ₁ (Sigma1), Ch, Maj (From Problem 1)\n",
    "   - The variables `a..h` change a little bit each round.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Produce the new hash value**  \n",
    "   - After the 64 rounds finish, the final `a..h` values are **added back** to the original hash.  \n",
