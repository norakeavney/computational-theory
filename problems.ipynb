    "\n",
    "There are several common approaches attackers can use to recover passwords from SHA-256 hashes. These techniques do not reverse the hash function itself, but instead try likely inputs and compare their hashes to the target value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Dictionary Attack\n",
    "A dictionary attack involves hashing words from a predefined list, such as common passwords or English words, and checking for a match. This is one of the most effective techniques against weak passwords and was the main approach used to recover the passwords in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference:  \n",
    "(What are Dictionary attacks – Jump Cloud)[https://jumpcloud.com/it-index/what-are-dictionary-attacks]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Brute-Force Attack\n",
    "A brute-force attack tries every possible combination of characters until a matching hash is found. While this approach is guaranteed to succeed in theory, it quickly becomes impractical as password length increases due to the exponential number of combinations.\n",
    "\n",

    "(Brute force attacks explained – Cloudflare)[https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/threats/brute-force-attack/]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Rainbow Tables\n",
    "Rainbow tables are large, precomputed tables that store plaintext passwords alongside their corresponding hashes. They allow for extremely fast lookups but require significant storage space and are ineffective when salts are used. Rainbow tables are mainly useful against unsalted hash databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference:  \n",
    "(Understanding Rainbow tables – GeeksforGeeks)[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/understanding-rainbow-table-attack/]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.4 Hash Lookup Databases\n",
    "Hash lookup databases store collections of previously cracked hashes. If a given hash exists in one of these databases, the original password can be retrieved almost instantly. This method works well for very common passwords that appear frequently in data breaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.5 Mask/Hybrid Attacks\n",
    "Mask or hybrid attacks combine dictionary attacks with common patterns or rules, such as capitalisation, number suffixes, or symbol substitutions. This approach is effective against passwords that follow predictable human patterns, such as replacing letters with numbers or symbols.\n",

    "### 3.6 Machine Learning / Probabilistic Guessing Models\n",
    "More advanced techniques use machine learning to generate likely password guesses based on real leaked password datasets. These models prioritise guesses that resemble real human password choices, improving efficiency compared to traditional brute-force methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.7 Markov Chain Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov chain attacks generate password guesses based on the statistical likelihood of character sequences occurring in real passwords. Instead of treating each character independently, the attack models how likely one character is to follow another, based on previously observed password data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the attacker to prioritise guesses that resemble human-created passwords, making the attack more efficient than pure brute force. While more advanced than a simple dictionary attack, Markov-based approaches are still practical and are implemented in real-world password cracking tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the passwords in this problem, simpler dictionary-based methods were already sufficient, so a Markov chain attack would not provide a significant advantage. However, it is effective against longer, more complex passwords that still follow human patterns.\n",

    "## 4. Comparison of Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "For the passwords in this task, rainbow tables and dictionary attacks are the most effective and practical approaches. Rainbow tables allow instant identification of well-known passwords through precomputed hash lookups, while dictionary attacks work by hashing likely candidates and comparing them directly. Since all of the recovered passwords were weak or highly predictable, these methods were more than sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced techniques such as brute-force attacks or GPU-accelerated cracking are unnecessary in this case, as they are designed for exploring much larger search spaces. Approaches like Markov chain attacks are more intuitive and human-like, as they prioritise guesses that resemble real password patterns, but even these are excessive for passwords that already appear in common wordlists or lookup databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Improving Password Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The passwords in this task were recovered because they were hashed using SHA-256 without additional protections. While SHA-256 is a secure cryptographic hash function, it is not well designed for password storage. The following improvements would prevent the types of attacks used to recover the passwords in this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Salting Passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Passwords should always be salted before hashing. A salt is a random value added to the password prior to hashing, ensuring that identical passwords do not result in identical hashes. This prevents the use of rainbow tables and hash lookup databases, as precomputed hashes will no longer match stored values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Key Stretching and Work Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Key stretching involves hashing a password multiple times using a configurable work factor. Increasing the number of iterations raises the computational cost of each guess, making large-scale password guessing attacks far more time-consuming while remaining practical for legitimate authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Adding a Secret Pepper\n",
    "\n",
    "A pepper is an additional secret value combined with the password during hashing, similar to a salt, but stored separately from the password database. Even if an attacker gains access to the hashed passwords, the absence of the pepper prevents direct verification of guessed passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Memory-Hard Hashing Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced memory-hard hashing techniques, such as Balloon hashing, further improve resistance to offline attacks. These approaches require both significant memory and CPU resources, making attacks using GPUs or specialised hardware much less effective. Memory-hard functions directly address the scalability advantages attackers gain from parallel hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.5 Conclusion\n",
    "In practice, the most effective defence against password cracking is not a single technique, but a combination of several approaches. Using salted, slow, password-specific hashing algorithms alongside key stretching and memory-hard constructions would significantly reduce the feasibility of dictionary, rainbow table, and rule-based attacks. Adding a secret pepper provides an additional layer of protection even if the password database is compromised. However, these improvements come with increased computational cost and implementation complexity, and some newer techniques require further evaluation before widespread adoption. As a result, real-world systems must balance security, performance, and maturity when choosing a password hashing strategy.\n",
