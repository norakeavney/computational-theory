    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Start with the message of length (L) bits.  \n",
    "2. Add a single `1` bit (`0x80` in hex, that marks the end of the original data.  \n",

    "4. Add the **64-bit big-endian** representation of L (the original bit length).  \n",
    "   – “Big-endian” means the most significant byte is written first. \n",
